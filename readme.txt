Troubleshooting

//----------Troubleshooting-----------//

Remove the Bluetooth module to connect the board via USB cable
If the motor acts weirdly, recalibrate the ESC
Re-starting the GUI fixs a lot of problem
The aerofoil zero angle is wrong, press the push-button on the PDB when the aerofoil is at the right angle
The airflow velocity is wrong, adjust the value thanks to the potentiometre on the PDB
The system response is not symmetric, the crank must be readjusted and balanced
If the motor drawn suddenly to much current the power supply turns off itself, recalibrate the ESC
The app does mot start, install the right JAVA jdk version (provided)
