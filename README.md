# Flight-Desk-Control-Demonstrator
The aim of a control system is to obtain a desired output response according to an input command. This can be achieved by knowing a model of the system with an open-loop control. However, an accurate model can be difficult to obtain. With a closed-loop control system, the controller determines the input signal of the process by using the measurement of the output. The most used method in the industry world involves PID correction.  The concept of feedback control and the choice of the three gains (Proportional, Integrator, Derivative) for a simple PID controller can be quite hard for students to conceptualize and understand their effectiveness. The aim of this project is to develop a simple feedback system for aerospace students to understand the nature of feedback control, the choice and the influence of the PID terms. The system consists of a demonstrator for the control of the pitch angle of a simple aerofoil by means of a regulated flap. The PID controller is implemented into an Arduino board programmed in C++ connected via Bluetooth to the GUI on a computer programmed in JAVA. It is possible to plot and save the output of the demonstrator as well as send new settings to the controller.
