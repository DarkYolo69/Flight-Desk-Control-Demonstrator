//---Fligh Desk Control Demonstrator--//
//--------Cranfield University--------//
//-------------Version V1-------------//

'
//----------------Warning-------------//
'
Remove the Bluetooth module to connect the board by USB cable
The internal 1.1V of the board is used to measure analogic data with the ADC
The demonstrator is designed to work in Bluetooth, The values may differ using the USB cable
'
//-------------How to use-------------//
'
Pair the Bluetooth model, Password: 1234, Name: FLIGHT_DESK_DEMONSTRATOR
With the GUI, Connect (this can take a few seconds)
The settings are sent automatically except the command angle
The zero angle of the aerofoil can be reset by pushing the button on the PDB
'
//-----------Default Values-----------//
'
P = 0, I = 0, D = 0
Limit angle +/-15deg
Sampling time = 2ms
Baud rate = 112500
Data sending every 25ms
Cut-off frequency Derivative term filter fc = 8.38Hz
Cut-off frequency potentiometre analogic input filter fc = 0.96Hz
Cut-off frequency Pitot tube analogic input filter fc = 0.016Hz
Buzzer tone 300ms
Turbine power control ramp 1/100 (%/ms)
The angle sent to the servo is 3 times the setpoint to get the righ flap deflection
Neutral PWM duty cycle for the servo 1500
Minimum PWM duty cycle for the turbine 1000
Maximun PWM duty cycle for the turbine 2000
With the differential OpAmp maximal value from the Pitot Tube is 1796Pa for Vout = 3.6V
Excel files created have 600 points maximum (FIFO lists)
2 decimals only for all floats
'
//-------------Pitot Tube-------------//
'
Vout = VS × (0.2 × P(kPa)+0.5) ± 6.25% VFSS 
VS = 5.0V, VFSS = 4.0V
Bernoulli to vitesse v = sqrt(2*P(Pa)/rho)
rho = 1.225 Kg/m3
The zero of the Pitot tube can be adjusted thanks to the potentiometre on the PDB
The Potentiomtre is very sensitive
